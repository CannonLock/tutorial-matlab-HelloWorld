[title]: - "Basics of compiled MATLAB applications - Hello World example"
[TOC]
 
## Overview

[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) is a proprietary software and requires license to run the applications.  However, compiled MATLAB binary does not require license.  The MATLAB programs are compiled by the MATLAB compiler `mcc`. The MATLAB compiler supports most of the toolboxes and user-developed 
interfaces. For more details, check the list of supported toolboxes (http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/supported/compiler_support.html) and 
ineligible programs (http://www.mathworks.com/products/ineligible_programs/). 

In this tutorial, we learn the basics of compiling MATLAB program on a licensed machine and run the compiled binary on OSG connect. 



## Compiling MATLAB on a machine with license 

MATLAB compiler `mcc` allows one to create standalone binary from the MATLAB program. The standalone binary runs on a machine without license but the binary requires correct version of MATLAB runtime and operating system. The MATLAB runtime are available freely from MathWorks (http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/). The version of MATLAB runtime should match with the version of MATLAB compiler. OSG machines are based on linux, so it is required to compile MATLAB on linux machines.  

### MATLAB script - hello_world.m 

Lets start with a simple MATLAB script `hello_world.m` that prints `hello world` to the standard output. 
    
    function helloworld
        fprintf('\n=============')
        fprintf('\nHello, World!\n')
        fprintf('=============\n')
    end  

### Compilation 

On a machine with MATLAB license, invoke the compiler `mcc`. We turn off all graphical options (-nodisplay), disable Java (-nojvm), and 
instruct MATLAB to run this application as a single-threaded application (-singleCompThread). 

    mcc -m -R -singleCompThread -R -nodisplay -R -nojvm hello_world.m

The flag -m means `c` language translation during compilation and the flag `-R`means runtime options.  The compilation would produce the 
files: hello_world, run_hello_world.sh, mccExcludedFiles.log and readme.txt files.  The file `hello_world` is the compiled binary 
file. "run_hello_world.sh" is the script file that executes the binary. `mccExcludedFiles.log` is the log file. `readme.txt` contains the 
information about the compilation process. 


## OSG Connect: Running the standalone binary applications

MATLAB runtime should be available on a machine to run the compiled binary applications. On OSG connect, a few versions of MATLAB runtime are available on OASIS as distributed environmental 
modules. To see whats available on OSG connect

    $ ssh username@login.osgconnect.net   # login on OSG connect login node
    $ module avail matlab
    
    --------------------------------- /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/modulefiles/Core -----------------------------------------
    matlab/2013b    matlab/2014a    matlab/2014b    matlab/2015a (D)

    Where:
     (D):  Default Module

    Use "module spider" to find all possible modules.
    Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching any of the "keys".

The above listed matlab modules are the available MATLAB runtime on OSG connect. Any standalone binary produced by above `mcc` version 
should run on OSG connect. 

### Tutorial files

Let us say you have created the standalone binary `hello_world`. Transfer the files `hello_world` and `run_hello_world.sh` to the login.osgconnect.net. You may also use the readily available files on login.osgconnect.net via `tutorial` command. 


In the command prompt, type 

$ tutorial matlab-HelloWorld # Copies input and script files to the directory tutorial-matlab-HelloWorld.
 
This will create a directory `tutorial-matlab-HelloWorld`. Inside the directory, you will see the following files
   
    hello_world             # compiled executable binary of hello_world.m
    hello_world.submit      # condor job description file
    run_hello_world.sh      # execution script
### Executing the MATLAB binary

The shell script `run_hello_world.sh` executes the binary `hello_world`. It takes the path of the MATLAB runtime as an 
input argument. The supplied `hello_world` binary is compiled on linux machine with MATLAB 2015a. This means we need to have the same MATLAB 
runtime to execute the binary. The MATLAB runtime for 2015a version is located in the path  `/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/matlab/2015a/v85/`

On the terminal prompt, type

    $ ./run_hello_world.sh /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/matlab/2015a/v85/
    (would produce the following output)

    ------------------------------------------
    Setting up environment variables
    ---
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH is .:/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/matlab/2014b/v84//runtime/glnxa64:/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/matlab/2014b/v84//bin/glnxa64:/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/matlab/2014b/v84//sys/os/glnxa64:/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/matlab/2014b/v84//sys/opengl/lib/glnxa64
    
    =============
    Hello, World!
    =============

If you get the above output, the binary execution is successful. Next, we see how we submit the job to a remote worker machine 
using HTcondor. 

### Job execution and submission files

Let us take a look at `hello_world.submit` file: 

    Universe = vanilla                          # One OSG Connect vanilla, the preffered job universe is "vanilla"

    Executable =  run_hello_world.sh    # Job execution file which is transffered to worker machine
    Arguments = /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/modules/matlab/2014b/v84/ # path of matlab runtime libraries 
    transfer_input_files = hello_world  # list of file(s) need be transffered to the remote worker machine 

    Output = Log/job.$(Process).outâ‹…            # standard output 
    Error =  Log/job.$(Process).err             # standard error
    Log =    Log/job.$(Process).log             # log information about job execution

    requirements = HAS_CVMFS_oasis_opensciencegrid_org =?= True   # Check if the worker machine has CVMFS 

    queue 10                                     # Submit 10  jobs


Before job submission, we need to make sure that the directory `Log` exists on the current working directory. Because HTcondor looks for 
`Log` directory to copy the standard output, error and log files as specified in the job description file. 

From your work directory, type

    $ mkdir -p Log

Absence of `Log` directory would send the jobs to held state. 

### Job submmision 


We submit the job using `condor_submit` command as follows

	$ condor_submit hello_world.submit //Submit the condor job description file "wigner_distribution.submit"

Now you have submitted the an ensemble of 10 MATLAB jobs printing `hello world` on the standard output. You can check the status of the submitted job by using the `condor_q` command as follows

	$ condor_q username  # The status of the job is printed on the screen. Here, username is your login name.


### Job Outputs 

The `hello_world.m` script sends the output to standard output. In the condor job description file, we expressed that the standard output is written on the `Log/job.$(ProcessID).out`. After job completion, ten output files are produced with the `hello world` message under the directory `Log`. 

## What next 
Sure, it is not very exciting to print same message on 10 output files. In the subsequent MATLAB examples,  we see  how to scale up MATLAB computation on HTC environment.
